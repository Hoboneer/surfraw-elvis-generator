# TODO List

- Add comment to generated scripts that it was the result of running `mkelvis`?
- Allow options to be specified (flags, yes/no options, options with fixed set of valid args)
	- Generate bash completions
	- As part of this, perhaps ask surfraw devs to add completion support to all of the elvi (maybe get `mkelvis` used?)
