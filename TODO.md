# TODO List

- Add comment to generated scripts that it was the result of running `mkelvis`?
- Allow options to be specified (flags, yes/no options, options with fixed set of valid args)
	- Generate bash completions
		- Prevent a space being added when completing option names with arguments
	- As part of this, perhaps ask surfraw devs to add completion support to all of the elvi (maybe get `mkelvis` used?)
- Make installable via `pip`
	- Create `setup.py` file
	- Make the program a Python package
	- Upload to PyPI
